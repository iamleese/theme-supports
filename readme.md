This plugin gives WordPress core blocks an extra boost so that they can be used within block theme templates.

## Block Filters

1. **Cover Image Block:** Added a default image when the "use featured image" option is selected. This prevents a blank header.
1. **Post Featured Image Block:** Added a default image option so that post lists look consistent.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/theme-supports` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
